Since then, I have been pushing on a very specific problem that keeps coming up when using AI with Drupal.\n\nAsk an AI assistant a seemingly simple Drupal question and you often get an answer that is almost right, but subtly wrong. A hook that no longer exists. An example that only applies to an older major version. Advice that ignores how Drupal actually structures its APIs today.\n\nThe root cause is usually not the model itself, but context. The AI does not know which Drupal version you are working with, and it does not have reliable access to the API documentation that matters for your project.\n\nOver the last months I have been experimenting with a way to fix that. The result is a proof of concept that is starting to feel genuinely useful: a locally hosted MCP server that gives AI assistants intelligent, version-specific access to Drupal’s API documentation, directly from your development environment.\n\n## Why This Started\n\nAt first glance it seems like modern AI tools should solve this problem automatically. Large language models are trained on vast amounts of public code and documentation, so it is reasonable to expect them to answer Drupal questions correctly.\n\nIn practice, that assumption breaks down for two related reasons.\n\nFirst, AI models are trained on a mixture of Drupal versions. When you are working on a specific Drupal 10 or Drupal 11 project, the answers you get may be based on outdated or mixed information. Even small version differences can lead to incorrect suggestions.\n\nSecond, AI tools have limited visibility into Drupal’s core APIs at development time. In a typical Composer-based setup, much of Drupal’s API is just a dependency and the actual files are not part of your IDE indexes. That means the assistant often relies on its training data or web search, rather than the actual APIs available to your project.\n\nThe result is an assistant that knows a lot about Drupal in general, but too little about the exact version you are working with. What I wanted was a way to make the right API documentation for the right Drupal version available to AI tools, locally and directly, as part of the development workflow.\n\n## How It Works: from Core Docs to Your IDE\n\nThe key idea is simple: precompute documentation embeddings once per Drupal version, then let AI query them locally at runtime.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph Maintainer[\"🔧 Maintainer Workflow\"]\n        direction LR\n        A1[Drupal Core\u003Cbr/>*.api.php files] -->|Parse| A2[API Documentation]\n        A2 -->|Generate Embeddings| A3[Ollama\u003Cbr/>Embedding Model]\n        A3 -->|Export| A4[JSON Files\u003Cbr/>in Git]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph EndUser[\"👤 End User Workflow\"]\n        direction TB\n        B1[JSON Files\u003Cbr/>from Git] -->|Hydrate| B2[Redis\u003Cbr/>Vector Store]\n        B3[IDE\u003Cbr/>Cursor/Claude] -->|Query| B4[MCP Server]\n        B4 -->|Generate Query Embedding| B5[Ollama\u003Cbr/>Embedding Model]\n        B5 -->|Query Vector| B4\n        B4 -->|Vector Search| B2\n        B2 -->|Results| B4\n        B4 -->|Documentation| B3\n    end\n    \n    Maintainer -->|Pre-computed| EndUser\n    \n    style A1 fill:#16A085,stroke:#138D75,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style A2 fill:#5C6BC0,stroke:#3F51B5,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style A3 fill:#F39C12,stroke:#D68910,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style A4 fill:#FF9800,stroke:#F57C00,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style B1 fill:#FF9800,stroke:#F57C00,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style B2 fill:#E74C3C,stroke:#C0392B,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style B3 fill:#4A90E2,stroke:#2E5C8A,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style B4 fill:#9B59B6,stroke:#6C3483,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n    style B5 fill:#F39C12,stroke:#D68910,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff\n```\n\nBehind the scenes, the workflow looks like this:\n\n**Ingestion & Embedding (maintainers only)**\n\nDrupal's core API files are parsed to extract documentation blocks. We generate vector embeddings with a local model (via Ollama) and export them as JSON in the repo.\n\n**Hydration (end users)**\n\nYou load those embeddings into a Redis vector store. This makes semantic search fast and offline-friendly.\n\nYour IDE (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) sends a natural-language query to the MCP server.\n\nThe server:\n- Detects your Drupal version from `composer.lock`\n- Generates an embedding for the query\n- Searches Redis for the most relevant documentation\n- Returns structured results with matching API docs + examples\n\nThat means asking things like \"What hook runs when an entity is saved?\" returns real matches from the right Drupal version — not just generic text or guesswork.\n\n## Key Components Under the Hood\n\nEverything in this stack is locally hosted and open-source:\n\n- [MCP PHP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk) for the MCP\n\n- PHP-Parser + DocBlock extraction for scraping API docs using [nikic/PHP-Parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser)\n- Redis with [redis-applied-ai/redis-vector-php](https://github.com/redis-applied-ai/redis-vector-php) for storage\n- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for embedding generation (no API keys, local models)\n- Docker & Docker-Compose to orchestrate Redis and Ollama easily\n- And obviously with PHP and Symfony to tie it all together\n\nBecause it's local, you avoid sending code or docs to external services and can work fully offline.\n\n## MCP Tools You Can Use Today\n\nThe server exposes several MCP tools that AI assistants can use:\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `drupal_search` | Semantic natural-language search |\n| `drupal_lookup` | Lookup specific hook/class by name |\n| `drupal_versions` | Show which Drupal versions are available |\n| `drupal_set_version` | Override default version |\n| `drupal_app_info` | Detect version from project |\n\nThose tools give clients rich, structured access to the API docs — something no existing Drupal-AI integration currently offers.\n\n## Example\n\nHere’s a concrete example that highlights the problem and the impact of version-aware documentation.\n\nIn Drupal `11.2.x` [New hook_entity_duplicate() and hook_ENTITY_TYPE_duplicate() hooks](https://www.drupal.org/node/3268812) were introduced. When asking an AI assistant about entity duplication behavior, the correct answer depends entirely on whether those hooks exist in the current Drupal version.\n\n[![Drupal 10 without MCP](./assets/D10-withoutMCP-small.png)](/images/blog/D10-withoutMCP.png)\n\n*Drupal 10 - without MCP usage:*\n\nThe AI suggests the actual hooks that do not exist in Drupal 10. The answer sounds plausible, but it is based on newer APIs and therefore incorrect for this project.\n\n[![Drupal 10 with MCP](./assets/D10-withMCP-small.png)](/images/blog/D10-withMCP.png)\n\n*Drupal 10 With MCP:*\n\nWith MCP enabled, the AI has access to Drupal 10–specific API documentation. The response correctly avoids the new hooks and instead references APIs that actually exist in this version.\n\n[![Drupal 11 with MCP](./assets/D11-withMCP-small.png)](/images/blog/D11-withMCP.png)\n\n*Drupal 11 With MCP:*\n\nIn a Drupal 11 environment, the same question now produces a different, version-appropriate answer. The AI correctly references the newly introduced hooks, because MCP exposes the relevant documentation for Drupal 11.2.x.\n\n## Where This Fits in the Drupal AI Landscape\n\nThis experiment reinforces an idea that keeps coming up when working with AI in real projects: better assistance is not all about better models or more elaborate prompts. Context matters more than most people expect.\n\nBy making Drupal’s API documentation version-aware, searchable, and locally accessible through MCP, AI tools can work with the same information an experienced Drupal developer would actively look up. That shifts AI from guessing based on training data to answering based on the actual platform and version you are using.\n\nThis approach could form the foundation of a Drupal AI starter kit that offers version-correct suggestions, safer refactoring, and scaffolding that follows Drupal conventions instead of fighting them.\n\nThere are already related efforts in the community, such as the [Drupal MCP module](https://www.drupal.org/project/mcp) module, and I think there is room to explore how something like Surge could evolve into a shared, possibly cloud-hosted MCP service for Drupal. But even in its current local-only form, this experiment already proves the value of version-aware documentation access.\n\nIf you are interested in where this could go next, [I would love to continue the conversation on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/surge/issues/3563383#comment-16384867), or you can explore the code yourself in the surge-mcp-dev repository at [ronaldtebrake/surge-mcp-dev](https://github.com/ronaldtebrake/surge-mcp-dev/).","src/content/blog/building-local-drupal-api-mcp-server.md",[28,29,30,31],"./assets/D10-withoutMCP-small.png","./assets/D10-withMCP-small.png","./assets/D11-withMCP-small.png","./assets/building-version-aware-mcp.webp","1fe2d48467c1deb5",{"html":34,"metadata":35},"\u003Cp>A while back, I wrote about \u003Ca href=\"/blog/embracing-ai-coding-starter-kit-drupal\">embracing AI in coding\u003C/a> and shared an idea for a Drupal starter kit that tightly integrates AI assistance into the development workflow.

You open the codebase, eager to solve a bug, only to be met with a decision that stops you in your tracks. \n\nThe function is insanely complex, and the choice of technology seems odd. You dig through the repository, commits, pull requests, search through Slack history, and even corner a senior developer for answers. But there’s no explanation—just silence and frustration. *Why did we choose this approach?* \n\nEventually, you patch the bug with your best guess. But in the back of your mind, doubt lingers: *Did I miss something important? Am I breaking an assumption I don’t understand or know about?*\n\nThis isn’t just a one-off annoyance. It’s a story many developers know all too well. Decisions made without context has its effect on teams, timelines, and morale. And often, the person struggling is you: six months or a year down the road, facing your own undocumented choices.\n\n### The day I became my own worst enemy\n\nWay in the early stages of Open Social we we're tasked with creating an activity stream, as you can imagine quite a vital piece of a social community. Time was tight, and decisions were made left right and center. We wanted to make sure this works without too many constraints on shared hosting, using what Drupal had to offer, to the best of our still evolving capabilities. Only just learning how to best work with a new Drupal major version, 8 at the time. I was so proud to see this as value being delivered.\n\nFast forward. We're now running in to performance issues, it's just not scalable. Trying to retrace our steps, trying to understand why certain components were built the way they were. And then it hit me: *I was the part of the team who refined, designed and create it*. \n\nBut could I remember why it was done the way it was? Nope. Was there a note, a Slack thread, or even a vague comment in the code? Also nope. My future self was left stranded by my past self’s haste.\n\n## Why documenting decisions matters\n\nEvery project is shaped by countless decisions. What language to use, which library or module to adopt, how to structure an API. These choices don’t happen in a vacuum. They’re shaped by constraints: deadlines, budgets, resources, knowledge, and tools. But those constraints evolve, and without context, decisions can quickly look arbitrary or even wrong.\n\nThis is why documenting decisions is so imporant. Whether they’re about design, architecture, or tooling. It’s not just about creating a historical record; it’s about preserving *context*. What problem were you trying to solve? Why did you choose this particular approach? What trade-offs or risks did you accept or why were there boundaries in the first place?\n\nIt’s a small investment that pays massive dividends when the project grows, the team changes, or the tech landscape shifts.\n\n## Decision records\n\nThat’s where Decision Records (DRs) come to the rescue.\n\nDecision records are simple yet powerful documents that capture the context, reasoning, and consequences of important decisions.\n\nAt their core, Decision Records are concise. They provide a snapshot of:\n\n- The problem or context: What led to the need for a decision?\n- The decision itself: What was chosen and implemented?\n- The alternatives considered: What other options were evaluated, and why were they not selected?\n- The consequences: What are the expected benefits, trade-offs, and risks?\n\nThis format allows an DR to serve as a standalone artifact, offering a clear explanation of the decision and its implications, even to someone unfamiliar with the project’s history. \n\nRather than changing them, you deprecate them and create a new one. Preserving them in a log, allow you to see why decisions changed over time. \n\n### Tips for starting with decision records\n\n#### **1. Start small, and use a template**\nYou don’t need to write a novel. Start small. Use a template, there are plenty of templates out there and you can hit the ground running.\nWe're using https://adr.github.io/madr/#full-template from the GitHub ADR organization.\n\n#### **2. Remove friction **\nStore decision records in your existing tools—whether that’s a Git repository, a wiki, or a shared folder. The easier it is to access, the more likely you’ll use it.\n\n#### **3. Make it part of your workflow**\nTie decision documentation to specific moments in your process. Don't expect these to be written down all of a sudden.\nMake a necessary artifact as part of your software development life cycle. Whether that is through your definition of done, or some place else.\n\n#### **4. Encourage feedback**\nFor bigger decisions, like architecture or process changes, first write a request for comments (RFC) and share it with your team, the outcome can be captured in a new decision record. This builds consensus and helps surface better ideas. Don't make it all about the decision.\n\n### A gift to your future self\n\nThe story I shared earlier isn’t unique. We’ve all been there staring at a decision we don’t understand, losing time and momentum as we try to make sense of it. \n\nBy embracing decision records, you’re not just documenting the past. You’re building a foundation. It shapes the culture of your team. \nIt allows your team (and you) to work faster, smarter, and with confidence. Context is key, and with a little effort, it doesn’t have to be missing.\n\nSo the next time you make a decision, take a moment to write it down.

From reuniting with old friends and making new connections to gaining insights into the future of Drupal, the event offered a lovely balance of networking and professional development, giving me all kinds of inspiration and motivation. So much so, I decided it’s about time I start sharing more through my own blog, and here we are.\n\n## A Glimpse Into the Future: The Driesnote and More\n\nThe highlight of the event was Dries Buytaert's keynote, where he unveiled the future of Drupal, particularly the Drupal CMS (formerly known as the Starshot) initiative. Seeing the potential of Drupal evolve into a no-code solution was inspiring. AI-powered tools that can automate everything from content migration to feature creation will fundamentally change the way people work with Drupal, making it more accessible to non-developers. This was more than just a demo; it was a glimpse into a future where site-building is easier, faster, and more intuitive.\n\nDoes that help distributions like Open Social? At first glance, it might seem far-fetched, and I have to admit I was a bit skeptical. Where recipes are becoming the new way of installing sets of dependencies and configuration, we're still trying to be an out-of-the-box solution for communities. Our community’s end users aren’t site builders, and we don’t need them to leverage most of those capabilities within our product.\n\nHowever, if you look deeper, a lot of the amazing work done for Drupal CMS we *will* be able to leverage. It's not that Drupal stops caring about Drupal Core, developers, or enterprise users. In order to create Drupal CMS, investments in the ecosystem will need to continue.\n\nI believe, similar to how Dries reflected on Gaudí's life’s work, the Sagrada Familia, and how it’s not just Gaudí’s legacy but also the work of many other craftsmen, Drupal CMS kickstarts a bunch of new, shiny features. Some we can directly use, but if anything, it serves as great inspiration for us to continue our efforts working on our community experience platform, following in the footsteps of those man-made marvels in Drupal core and the contrib ecosystem.\n\nAfter taking some time to digest everything I've learned, here are some of the exciting marvels that truly resonated with me.\n\n## Access Policy API\n\nKristiaan's session on the Access Policy API was perhaps my biggest highlight. Hearing Kristiaan talk about the API opened up my mind to a whole new range of possibilities for managing access within our communities.\n\n> Drupal has moved from an RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to a PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control) system where permissions are calculated based on a set of policies applied in a given context.\n\nWe now have tools available to dynamically add or revoke permissions. Instead of trying to fiddle with roles, permissions, or other attributes, we can create policies based on dynamic sets of conditions. These policies, being tagged services, can be prioritized, enabling us to determine a wide range of policies that can be applied to the business rules in our product while ensuring we fully understand what happened, in what order, and why.\n\nI’ll dive deeper into this in future blog posts, as it truly deserves a more in-depth look.\n\n## Experience Builder\n\nOne of the other sessions I attended focused on the new Experience Builder for Drupal. This tool is poised to be a game-changer, especially for content editors and site builders. It provides a seamless, user-friendly interface where users can build complex site layouts without needing to code. The Experience Builder offers a visual way to customize the site by dragging and dropping components, setting up reusable templates, and managing layouts in real time. This truly empowers non-developers to take full control of their site’s look and feel without compromising on flexibility or functionality.\n\nMy mind couldn’t help but wonder how we can leverage all of the amazing work done there to ensure our content editors can use the Experience Builder to create amazing dashboards and landing pages within our product. Currently using Layout Builder for this, it comes with a very Drupal-admin-like UI. Just seeing the current status of the Experience Builder, I can’t wait to give it a go and see how we can use it within our product.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence\n\nOne of the main focuses was the responsible implementation of AI, emphasizing transparency and the importance of a “human-in-the-loop” approach. A Q&A session and panel discussion on Drupal AI brought forward both excitement and concerns, showing the community’s dedication to ethical AI integration. This approach ensures AI remains an empowering tool while respecting user autonomy and security.\n\nAs Open Social has been working closely with FreelyGive, the maintainers of the Drupal AI module, we have already made significant progress in integrating AI. The insights shared in Barcelona highlighted the importance of using AI responsibly—keeping users informed and involved at every step. This approach will likely shape AI-driven tools for Drupal in ways that build on transparency and trust, helping to ease any worries about its impact on content management.\n\nWhile many demos, understandably, were dedicated to Drupal CMS, the groundwork here is usable for many more use cases. AI can help create more dynamic and personalized experiences by tailoring content to individual user interests, enhancing community engagement. For instance, AI-powered recommendations, adaptive search, and behavior-based content delivery can ensure users find relevant discussions, events, and resources, making the platform feel more intuitive and responsive. Automation tools for content moderation and user support can streamline operations, allowing community managers to focus on nurturing real interactions. By embedding ethical, transparent AI into these experiences, Drupal is set to empower us to build more connected, vibrant, and user-centric communities.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nAs the event concluded with the announcement that Vienna will host DrupalCon Europe 2025, I found myself already looking forward to the next opportunity to reunite with the community and continue pushing Drupal to new heights. Whether it was through sessions, networking, or exploring the city, this year’s DrupalCon Barcelona truly showcased the best of what our community has to offer.\n\nYou can expect a lot more in-depth posts about the above, so stay tuned.","src/content/blog/drupalcon-2024-barcelona.md",[133],"./assets/antoni-gaudi-community-experience-building-dall-e.webp","0b811e9460996098",{"html":136,"metadata":137},"\u003Cp>I had a wonderful time reconnecting with my peers at DrupalCon Barcelona 2024!

For instance, AI-powered recommendations, adaptive search, and behavior-based content delivery can ensure users find relevant discussions, events, and resources, making the platform feel more intuitive and responsive. Automation tools for content moderation and user support can streamline operations, allowing community managers to focus on nurturing real interactions. By embedding ethical, transparent AI into these experiences, Drupal is set to empower us to build more connected, vibrant, and user-centric communities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>As the event concluded with the announcement that Vienna will host DrupalCon Europe 2025, I found myself already looking forward to the next opportunity to reunite with the community and continue pushing Drupal to new heights.

Recently, the Laravel community unveiled Laravel Boost, an \"AI coding starter kit\" that tightly integrates AI assistance into the development workflow. This forward-thinking approach has sparked excitement and it presents a huge opportunity for Drupal. As a Drupal developer, it's clear that we can supercharge our productivity by giving AI the right tools and context to generate Drupal-specific code. In this post, we'll explore what Laravel Boost offers, examine Drupal's current (but fragmented) AI solutions, and envision how a Drupal AI coding starter kit could revolutionize our development experience.\n\n## Learning from Laravel's Boost Example\n\nLaravel Boost demonstrates the power of an officially supported AI integration. Announced at Laracon US 2025, Boost is a Composer package that developers can install to enhance AI pair-programming in Laravel. Its main features are impressive:\n\n**Laravel-Specific AI Server & Tools**: Boost runs a Laravel-focused MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with over 15 specialized \"tools\" that an AI agent can use. These tools let the AI safely query the database, execute code (via Tinker), read logs, search documentation, and more; all within the boundaries of your project. This means the AI can understand and manipulate a Laravel app's internals just like a developer would (for example, checking the DB schema or running artisan commands).\n\n**Ingested Documentation with Semantic Search**: All of Laravel's official docs (and those of popular packages like Livewire, Inertia, etc.) have been ingested and vectorized for semantic search. In practice, this dramatically reduces hallucinations because the AI can fetch up-to-date, version-specific documentation on demand. When asked about a framework feature, Boost's AI will pull the exact guidance from Laravel 10, 11, or 12 docs as needed, rather than guessing.\n\n**Curated AI Guidelines**: The Laravel team curated AI coding guidelines that teach the AI how to write code in the \"Laravel way\". Boost can generate configuration files for various AI tools (Cursor, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) with these rules baked in. The guidelines cover Laravel's coding style and even framework-specific conventions across different versions. For example, it knows to prefer certain design patterns, use the latest APIs, and even to write tests for new code.\n\n## The Current State of AI in Drupal Development\n\nSo, where does Drupal stand today with AI-assisted coding? Drupal developers have begun experimenting with AI, but the solutions are currently fragmented and experimental. A few notable efforts include:\n\n**Claude Code module**: A contributed module that integrates Anthropic's Claude AI assistant into Drupal workflows. It provides a CLAUDE.md file with Drupal-specific best practices and setup instructions for the AI. With a companion DDEV environment add-on, developers can chat with Claude about their Drupal code. It's a great start, but it's tailored specifically to Claude.\n\n**MCP & Context7**: Some Drupalists use MCP servers to feed real-time Drupal documentation to AI. For example, Context7 can serve version-specific docs and code examples, but it doesn’t cover coding standards from drupal.org. The Drupal MCP module can expose a site’s content or Drush commands to AI and make sure you can leverage your own custom commands, but there is no unified approach for AI there.\n\n**Custom AI \"Rules\" for Drupal**: Developers maintain their own guidelines for tools like Cursor to enforce Drupal standards (API usage, dependency injection, OWASP security practices, etc.). These rules are powerful, but duplicated and inconsistent across tools.\n\nLooking at this landscape, the pattern is clear: Drupal's AI tooling is strong in pieces but siloed. There’s no central integration tying everything together. That creates duplicated effort and inconsistent guidance. It also makes it harder for AI to stay aligned with the latest official standards.\n\n## Envisioning a Drupal AI Coding Starter Kit\n\nIf Drupal had its own AI starter kit, it should feel simple, unified, and community-driven. Here’s what that could mean in practice:\n\n- **Seamless setup:** Installing the kit should be as easy as adding a module or Composer package. One command, and your AI tool of choice is ready to “speak Drupal.”  \n\n- **Shared best practices:** Instead of scattered, tool-specific rules, Drupal could provide a single set of AI guidelines that capture our coding standards, security practices, and version-specific recommendations. These could extend into contrib, so modules like Commerce or Paragraphs can add their own AI knowledge.  \n\n- **Direct access to Drupal knowledge:** AI should be able to tap into Drupal’s documentation and API reference, ensuring its suggestions are accurate, version-aware, and grounded in official sources.  \n\n- **Actionable tools:** Beyond code suggestions, the kit could let AI perform safe, sandboxed developer tasks; like running Drush commands, scaffolding modules, or checking logs and streamlining the build-and-test cycle.\n\n- **Community-powered evolution:** Just as Drupal thrives on collaboration, so could its AI kit. As coding standards change and new modules emerge, the community could update and extend the shared AI knowledge base, keeping it fresh and reliable. We already have the community powered Drupal MCP server, it feels like a great opportunity we can potentially use.\n\nThe result would be a consistent, trusted layer that turns today’s fragmented AI experiments into a powerful, unified experience for every Drupal developer.\n\n## The Road Ahead: Unlocking Drupal's AI Potential\n\nBy drawing inspiration from Laravel Boost and building on our own experiments, we could create a Drupal AI coding starter kit that improves productivity and consistency. The benefits could include faster scaffolding, automated refactoring, and better adherence to standards.\n\nThat said, there are challenges. Keeping AI configs in sync with Drupal’s fast-moving APIs, avoiding overreliance on generated code, and ensuring community governance around “official” AI rules will be critical. A starter kit would need to balance convenience with careful guardrails.\n\nIf done well, though, AI in Drupal would not feel like a black box. It would be an extension of our shared standards and values. The code AI generates could reflect not just one developer’s rules, but the collective knowledge of the Drupal community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe opportunity for Drupal to have its own AI coding starter kit is significant. The discussion has already started in the community (See [AI coding starterkit proposal](https://www.drupal.org/project/ai_initiative/issues/3541110)), and the momentum is building. With a unified approach, Drupal can keep pace with evolving developer expectations while staying rooted in community-driven standards.\n\n### References\n\n- [AI coding starterkit proposal](https://www.drupal.org/project/ai_initiative/issues/3541110) - Drupal.org\n- [Laravel Boost, your AI coding starter kit](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-boost-ai-coding-starter-kit) - Laravel News\n- [Laravel Boost Introduction and Features](https://github.com/laravel/boost) - GitHub\n- [Claude Code Module Introduces AI Integration for Drupal](https://www.thedroptimes.com/47809/claude-code-module-introduces-ai-integration-drupal-development) - The Drop Times\n- [Claude Code meets Drupal](https://dri.es/claude-code-meets-drupal) - Dries Buytaert\n- [Context7 MCP Service](https://mcp.aibase.com) - AIbase\n- [Drupal MCP Module](https://drupalmcp.io) - Drupal MCP\n- [Drupal 10 Module Development Rules](https://cursor.directory/rules/drupal) - Cursor Directory\n- [Cursor AI Project Rules for Modern Development](https://github.com/ivangrynenko/cursorrules) - ivangrynenko","src/content/blog/embracing-ai-coding-starter-kit-drupal.md","c9fd59726d430a56",{"html":172,"metadata":173},"\u003Cp>Artificial Intelligence is rapidly changing how we write and maintain code.

Over the past few months, I’ve been experimenting with tools like **Cline**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor**. These tools can be incredibly powerful, but using them effectively requires understanding their limitations. We've been joking at Open Social for years now that we still haven't invented \"human cloning\" and we are somewhat limited by the resources we have, so is AI going to \"finally\" fix this once and for all, or perhaps even replace us?\n\nThis post dives into how I'm approaching using AI within the context of **Drupal** development at Open Social.\n\n## AI as your newest hire\n\nWhen I first started using AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude, I noticed that their outputs lacked the quality I perhaps expected it to have. While they were fast, eager, and capable of generating working solutions, they reminded me of new developers navigating their first weeks on the job.\n\nThe first time you see it provide output that looks like it has the potential to \"work,\" it's so exciting. It's like you're pair programming with a new developer that grasps some of the fundamentals but gets lost in the nuances; the quality felt similar to that of a junior developer referencing patterns in our codebase we would consider technical debt.\n\nWorking with Drupal in a context like Open Social requires a deep understanding of not only the platform but also the stricter standards we’ve imposed to ensure quality. These tools lack that intrinsic understanding, as almost any new developer would at first, as these are standards imposed by us at Open Social and differ from most working places, even those in the Drupal ecosystem.\n\nFor example, we are currently moving away from hooks in the `.module` file to object-oriented techniques that are more in line with modern practices. While this will [become available in Drupal 11.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/3442349), it's a fairly new choice for the Drupal ecosystem as well as within Open Social. We even do this using [Hux](https://www.drupal.org/project/hux) as we are working with versions before Drupal 11.1 still.\n\nThis highlighted a key issue: AI doesn’t inherently know the history behind decisions or the rationale for avoiding certain approaches, nor is this widely available in the data it seems to be trained on. It's not even in our full code base yet. We can't expect this from a new developer, so how can we expect AI to understand?\n\n**How to Put AI on Your Team**\n\nIn software development, [**context is important**](https://www.ronaldtebrake.nl/blog/context-is-key-but-missing/). When we onboard a new developer, we don't just hand them the repository and hope for the best; we guide them through the intricacies of our codebase, our workflows, and our culture. But bringing an AI model into the fold comes with its own set of challenges. An AI tool might quickly learn your entire codebase that means it will also learn about your technical debt, while it won’t automatically grasp your engineering culture, project history, or the reasoning behind established best practices.\n\nInstead, AI depends on structured guidance; predefined rules, curated patterns, and clear context—to generate relevant suggestions. In some ways, this process can favor more senior developers, who already know what “good” looks like and can refine an AI-generated proposal. However, several emerging tools aim to bridge this gap for all experience levels. For example, **Copilot Workspaces**[^1] and **Cline**[^2] now provide features that allow a developer to plan before implementation, enabling a more deliberate, pair-programming-like approach when working alongside AI tools. Similarly, platforms like **Cursor**[^3] (with “Cursor Rules”) let teams encode their best practices into the AI itself, so generated code is more likely to adhere to team standards.\n\nYet each tool’s approach to governance differs, and not all are compatible with every IDE. Our teams, for instance, use multiple editors, so something like Cline—which currently supports only Visual Studio Code—wouldn’t cover everyone. This brings up broader concerns about cost, licensing, privacy, and the security of intellectual property. At the same time, we want to uphold our principle of autonomy and trust. Simply banning AI tools would run counter to innovation; instead, we need to incorporate AI responsibly and ensure it genuinely raises quality and productivity.\n\nThat’s why establishing clear **AI governance structures**[^4] is critical. These policies define precisely how AI can be used, what kind of data it can train on, and which guardrails developers must respect whilst also increasing adoption. By setting these boundaries, we can safeguard security, maintain team autonomy, and ensure AI remains a valuable collaborator rather than an unpredictable wildcard. Ultimately, careful integration of AI—supported by the right policies, tools, and cultural alignment—has the potential to make our teams more efficient, more creative, and even more cohesive.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAI has the potential to be a game-changer in software development, currently not as a replacement for human expertise, but as a buddy that enhances productivity and creativity. By embedding AI responsibly into our workflows, we can find that balance between automation and human judgment not just focussing on output but on outcome, making AI a true team player in engineering rather than just another tool. \nRemember, there might not be an I in team; But I do see there is room for AI in our teams and I'm really looking forward to explore this space even more, so in my next posts, I'll dive deeper into some of the tools I've been testing.\n\n### References\n\n[^1]: [Copilot Workspace](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace)\n\n[^2]: [Cline AI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cline.ai)\n\n[^3]: [Cursor Documentation](https://www.cursor.sh/docs)\n\n[^4]: [Empower developers with AI policy and governance](https://resources.github.com/learn/pathways/copilot/essentials/empower-developers-with-ai-policy-and-governance)","src/content/blog/is-there-an-ai-in-team.md",[213],"./assets/is-there-ai-in-team.webp","ac914450fb14566d",{"html":216,"metadata":217},"\u003Cp>Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have become increasingly common in software engineering, promising to streamline development and improve productivity.

We even do this using \u003Ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/hux\">Hux\u003C/a> as we are working with versions before Drupal 11.1 still.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This highlighted a key issue: AI doesn’t inherently know the history behind decisions or the rationale for avoiding certain approaches, nor is this widely available in the data it seems to be trained on. It’s not even in our full code base yet. We can’t expect this from a new developer, so how can we expect AI to understand?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>How to Put AI on Your Team\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In software development, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ronaldtebrake.nl/blog/context-is-key-but-missing/\">\u003Cstrong>context is important\u003C/strong>\u003C/a>. When we onboard a new developer, we don’t just hand them the repository and hope for the best; we guide them through the intricacies of our codebase, our workflows, and our culture. But bringing an AI model into the fold comes with its own set of challenges. An AI tool might quickly learn your entire codebase that means it will also learn about your technical debt, while it won’t automatically grasp your engineering culture, project history, or the reasoning behind established best practices.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Instead, AI depends on structured guidance; predefined rules, curated patterns, and clear context—to generate relevant suggestions. In some ways, this process can favor more senior developers, who already know what “good” looks like and can refine an AI-generated proposal. However, several emerging tools aim to bridge this gap for all experience levels. For example, \u003Cstrong>Copilot Workspaces\u003C/strong>\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> and \u003Cstrong>Cline\u003C/strong>\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-2\" id=\"user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">2\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> now provide features that allow a developer to plan before implementation, enabling a more deliberate, pair-programming-like approach when working alongside AI tools. Similarly, platforms like \u003Cstrong>Cursor\u003C/strong>\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-3\" id=\"user-content-fnref-3\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">3\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> (with “Cursor Rules”) let teams encode their best practices into the AI itself, so generated code is more likely to adhere to team standards.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yet each tool’s approach to governance differs, and not all are compatible with every IDE. Our teams, for instance, use multiple editors, so something like Cline—which currently supports only Visual Studio Code—wouldn’t cover everyone. This brings up broader concerns about cost, licensing, privacy, and the security of intellectual property. At the same time, we want to uphold our principle of autonomy and trust. Simply banning AI tools would run counter to innovation; instead, we need to incorporate AI responsibly and ensure it genuinely raises quality and productivity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That’s why establishing clear \u003Cstrong>AI governance structures\u003C/strong>\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fn-4\" id=\"user-content-fnref-4\" data-footnote-ref=\"\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">4\u003C/a>\u003C/sup> is critical. These policies define precisely how AI can be used, what kind of data it can train on, and which guardrails developers must respect whilst also increasing adoption. By setting these boundaries, we can safeguard security, maintain team autonomy, and ensure AI remains a valuable collaborator rather than an unpredictable wildcard. Ultimately, careful integration of AI—supported by the right policies, tools, and cultural alignment—has the potential to make our teams more efficient, more creative, and even more cohesive.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>AI has the potential to be a game-changer in software development, currently not as a replacement for human expertise, but as a buddy that enhances productivity and creativity. By embedding AI responsibly into our workflows, we can find that balance between automation and human judgment not just focussing on output but on outcome, making AI a true team player in engineering rather than just another tool. \nRemember, there might not be an I in team; But I do see there is room for AI in our teams and I’m really looking forward to explore this space even more, so in my next posts, I’ll dive deeper into some of the tools I’ve been testing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"references\">References\u003C/h3>\n\u003Csection data-footnotes=\"\" class=\"footnotes\">\u003Ch2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"footnote-label\">Footnotes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli id=\"user-content-fn-1\">\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace\">Copilot Workspace\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 1\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli id=\"user-content-fn-2\">\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cline.ai\">Cline AI\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 2\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli id=\"user-content-fn-3\">\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.cursor.sh/docs\">Cursor Documentation\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fnref-3\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 3\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli id=\"user-content-fn-4\">\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://resources.github.com/learn/pathways/copilot/essentials/empower-developers-with-ai-policy-and-governance\">Empower developers with AI policy and governance\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"#user-content-fnref-4\" data-footnote-backref=\"\" aria-label=\"Back to reference 4\" class=\"data-footnote-backref\">↩\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003C/section>",{"headings":218,"localImagePaths":229,"remoteImagePaths":230,"frontmatter":231,"imagePaths":234},[219,222,225,226],{"depth":38,"slug":220,"text":221},"ai-as-your-newest-hire","AI as your newest hire",{"depth":38,"slug":223,"text":224},"final-thoughts","Final Thoughts",{"depth":86,"slug":191,"text":192},{"depth":38,"slug":227,"text":228},"footnote-label","Footnotes",[],[],{"title":203,"description":204,"pubDate":232,"heroImage":213,"category":209,"tags":233,"featured":24},"Feb 02 2025",[72,19,208],[],"is-there-an-ai-in-team.md","agent-skills-empower-ai-drupal",{"id":236,"data":238,"body":245,"filePath":246,"assetImports":247,"digest":249,"rendered":250,"legacyId":277},{"title":239,"description":240,"pubDate":241,"heroImage":242,"tags":243,"category":23,"featured":24},"Agent Skills: A New Way to Empower AI in Drupal","Exploring Agent Skills, an open standard for packaging AI knowledge into reusable skills, and how the Drupal community is adopting this approach to make AI coding assistants smarter and more efficient.",["Date","2026-01-09T23:00:00.000Z"],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_./assets/agent-skills.png",[19,20,244],"agent-skills","# Agent Skills: A New Way to Empower AI in Drupal\n\nArtificial Intelligence is moving fast, and new concepts keep emerging that change how we work with it. One concept I've been exploring lately is Agent Skills. This is an open standard introduced by Anthropic for packaging domain-specific knowledge for AI into reusable skills. In short, a skill is a bundle of instructions or code that an AI agent can load when needed, instead of having everything hard coded upfront. If you haven't heard of Agent Skills yet, I highly recommend the talk [Don't Build Agents, Build Skills Instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEvIs9y1uog) by Anthropic's Barry Zhang and Mahesh Murag. It explains the rationale behind this approach very clearly. In this post, I'll explain what Agent Skills are and why they matter, and then dive into how we're starting to use this concept in the Drupal community.\n\n## What Are Agent Skills (and Why Use Them)?\n\nAgent Skills are essentially folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that an AI agent can discover and load dynamically when they're relevant. Think of them as small apps or training manuals that give an AI specialized expertise in a specific domain. For example, one skill might teach an AI how to work with Excel spreadsheets, while another might encode your organization's coding guidelines. Most parts of these skills live outside the main system prompt. The agent will pull them in only when needed based on the metadata, which is a key difference from stuffing all knowledge into the prompt from the start.\n\nWhy is this helpful? For one, it keeps the AI's context slim and focused. Each skill provides a short name and description, static metadata that the AI can see, but the detailed instructions or scripts remain separate until invoked. The AI can decide, based on the task at hand, to load a particular skill by name. This means we can give the AI lots of potential knowledge without filling up its context with tons of text by default. In practical terms, this approach is far more token efficient, since only the necessary data is pulled into the prompt. It can even improve the quality of responses by reducing clutter or contradictory info in the AI's input. The AI isn't drowning in irrelevant details, it only sees the skill details when it actually needs them. This dynamic discovery of context, sometimes called dynamic context discovery, is a clever way to manage token usage and ensure the AI stays on track.\n\nAnother big benefit is that skills are modular and shareable. They are just files, often Markdown and scripts, that can be versioned and distributed. Anthropic spun off the Agent Skills concept as an open specification on [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/), and it's already being adopted by many AI tools. Not only Claude, but also other coding agents like OpenAI Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and more. In other words, skills are becoming a common language so that different AI agents can all use the same skill packs. This portability is great. You could write a skill once and use it with various AI assistants. It shifts the focus from building one-off, monolithic agents to building a library of reusable skills that any agent can grab when needed. As the Anthropic team put it, it's about going from brittle, custom agents to lightweight skills that can be shared, versioned, and loaded on the fly.\n\n## Bringing Agent Skills to Drupal\n\nSo how does this idea translate to the Drupal world? \n\nThe Drupal community has been quick to see the potential. Just days ago, a proposal was put forward for first class support for Agent Skills in Drupal. The idea is that we, as a community, can curate a set of Drupal specific skills and tooling so any AI assistant can readily use them. This would prevent every developer from having to reinvent their own ad hoc AI setup. As Fabian noted, it would be great to have a community maintained baseline of shareable skills to kickstart our development setups and establish good patterns. In fact, others had already begun experimenting and sharing their skills. Building on these ideas, we're starting to formalize things under Drupal's umbrella and it got me excited to start contributing and trying, as this is a perfect addition to Surge, the place where I'm trying to start an AI coding standard kit for Drupal development.\n\n## Distribution of skills\n\nTo make sharing easier, I helped create a project called [Agentic Skills on Drupal.org](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/ai_skills). This is essentially a curated library of Drupal focused Agent Skills following the Agent Skills specification. We store these skill files in a standard location. Currently we use a `.claude/skills` directory as there is no standardized directory yet, and that is the directory many AI tools recognize. The library can include anything from general Drupal coding guidelines to domain-specific skills. For example, a skill for working with Drupal's configuration system, or a skill for interacting with the Drupal.org issue queue.\n\nEach contributed skill in this library is automatically validated against the specification when someone creates a merge request. We built a validator in PHP based on the official [spec validator](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/blob/main/skills-ref/src/skills_ref/validator.py), to ensure every skill meets the format. This validation step helps maintain quality and consistency across the shared skills. The Agentic Skills library is our answer to the distribution challenge. It's a central place where Drupal developers can contribute and obtain ready made skills for Drupal work.\n\n## Aggregation and control\n\nOnce you have a library of available skills, you probably don't want to load every single skill into your project all at once, as Agents will be able to automatically discover them. Not every project needs every skill, or you might have your own custom tweaks to tailor skills to your projects needs. This is where configuration and aggregation come in.\n\nI've added a tool to Drupal Surge to help with this. This allows you to collect and configure the skills you want for your project, and copy them into your project's skills folder, all based on Composer and PHP. With Surge, you can pick which skills to include, rather than blindly pulling in the entire library. For example, if you're not using Drupal Commerce, you probably don't need any Commerce related AI skill that might be in the library loaded on your system. Surge lets you specify that. It scans for any skills provided by your enabled modules or by the Agentic Skills library, and then aggregates only the ones you've chosen into the `.claude/skills` directory that the agent will actually use. This gives developers control and keeps the AI's skill set tailored to the project's needs.\n\nThe ability to configure skill selection is important for a few reasons:\n\n- Relevance  \nYou avoid noise from skills that don't apply. Your AI agent only sees Drupal skills that match what you're working with.\n- Customization  \nIt's possible you have a custom or modified skill for your project. You can use that instead of a generic one. Surge can include your local or project specific skills alongside community ones and doesn't touch the existing skills you already have.\n- Efficiency  \nFewer skills loaded means less for the agent to scan through, which ties back to keeping context efficient.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAgent Skills represent a fresh approach to integrating AI with Drupal development. We can equip our AI tools with modular, on demand knowledge of our ecosystem. As a result, a coding agent can have the right skills for the job. \n\nBy adopting the open Agent Skills specification, we keep our AI context dynamic and efficient, only pulling in what's needed when it's needed and it's supported by many tools already, allowing you to pick whichever Agent you want.\n\nThere are still challenges to work through. We need to refine how skills are distributed, so they're easy to find and share and version. How they're aggregated, so each project can flexibly include the right set. But the work has begun. With a shared library of skills and tools like Surge for assembly, we're laying the groundwork. This collaboration between open standards and open source community know how could significantly boost our productivity, while keeping AI outputs aligned with Drupal best practices.\n\nIn short, Agent Skills give us a path to make AI development assistants smarter, and our own development experience smoother. A win win for everyone involved in developing with Drupal.\n\n## References\n\n- Anthropic Claude Blog  \nSkills explained: How Skills compares to prompts, Projects, MCP, and subagents  \n[https://website.claude.com/blog/skills-explained](https://website.claude.com/blog/skills-explained)\n- Drupal.org Issue  \nProposal: First class support for agent skills  \n[https://www.drupal.org/project/ai/issues/3565489](https://www.drupal.org/project/ai/issues/3565489)\n- Cursor Blog  \nDynamic context discovery  \n[https://cursor.com/blog/dynamic-context-discovery](https://cursor.com/blog/dynamic-context-discovery)","src/content/blog/agent-skills-empower-ai-drupal.md",[248],"./assets/agent-skills.png","bed17a71ea9ff59b",{"html":251,"metadata":252},"\u003Ch1 id=\"agent-skills-a-new-way-to-empower-ai-in-drupal\">Agent Skills: A New Way to Empower AI in Drupal\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Artificial Intelligence is moving fast, and new concepts keep emerging that change how we work with it.
